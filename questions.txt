Questions/doubts

Apply softmax to Wd  to display dict features properly, no sparsity penalty before that

Evaluation pipeline, MCC score, inspect r and c, hat(c)

Identifiability: Seb's paper, reason it's useful: diff modalities, in each a diff number of concepts is active-- recover this using sparsity-- look at their proof to see how to get statistical identifiability

How can this model disetangle on the basis of sparse perturbs?
